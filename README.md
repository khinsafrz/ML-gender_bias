ML Project - Investigating Gender Bias in Students Academic Success Prediction

This project examines gender bias in predicting academic success, which can lead to differential treatment and outcomes for male and female students.
A data set from Kaggle was used with Random Forest algorithm to investigate gender bias in predicting academic success. The project was done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
The experiment resulted in a group fairness bias, where the female students have higher positive rate compared to male students. However, the model is free from other bias criteria.
